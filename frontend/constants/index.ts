Meeting Transcript
Company: PT. RISKSIGHT AI
Date: June 12, 2024
Participants:
‚Ä¢ Reza (CEO)
‚Ä¢ Lita (CTO)
‚Ä¢ Dimas (CFO)
‚Ä¢ Maya (Product Lead)

Agenda:
‚Ä¢ Financial Condition
‚Ä¢ Market Competition
‚Ä¢ Technology Infrastructure Readiness
‚Ä¢ HR and Product Development

Discussion:

Reza:
"We only have about 4 months of runway left if we don't get additional funding. We need to find new investors quickly or look for other monetization strategies."

Dimas:
"Yes, our cash flow has declined since Q1. And operational costs have increased with the recent hiring."

Lita:
"There is a potential bottleneck in the development team. We're short on people for several key features."

Maya:
"A competitor from Singapore just launched a similar product with advanced analytics features. They're starting to take our market share in the retail sector."

Reza:
"We also need to think about how to ensure our backend system can handle if user growth doubles."

Additional Notes:
‚Ä¢ No legal framework yet for local data compliance regulations.
‚Ä¢ High dependency on one senior engineer for all deployments.
